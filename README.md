# Timeseries forecasting

In the notebook, various forecasting models are explored and their performance is compared. The contents are mostly based on the Tensorflow timeseries forecasting tutorial which uses weather data.

There are two categories of models : single-step prediction and multi-step prediction. 

- Single-step prediction
  
    * single-step input with linear and DNN models,
    * multi-step input using DNN, CNN, RNN:LSTM models.
  
- Multi-step prediction
  
  single-shot models
    * single-step input with linear and DNN,
    * multi-step input using CNN, RNN:LSTM
  
  autoregressive models
    * feedback RNN
